# Text-Mining-Experiments

We'll use this notebook to draft text mining scripts for analyzing features captured by the Docuscope dictionaries and related features.

We'll adapt a series of NLTK notebooks into Colab notebooks for analyzing a dataset as a first step.

This repo provides starting point for Jupyter Notebooks: https://github.com/hb20007/hands-on-nltk-tutorial

# Next Steps

1) Adapt NLTK Jupyter Notebooks to make a functional set of scripts in Google Colab for basic text mining
2) Experiment with building off these scripts using Spacy and Gensim
